# vscode-discord-cli

Visual studio extenstion that supports some kind of syntax highlighting for [discord-cli](https://github.com/cjavad/discord-cli)'s discordquery lang and offers an icon pack. ([#14662](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/14662) pls fix)

Very basic supports currently due to my lack of experience with vscode extenstions and TextMate language files.
Ended up having to use a generated .tmLanguage generated by Iro, but feel free to send a PR if you feel like extending its current features.
